# Sam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and sixth form student in the UK, currently in my final year working towards my A Levels. Next year I'll (hopefully) be studying Computer Science at university.

I have experience in a range of languages including Java, Python, Go, and technologies such as MySQL, MongoDB, Maven, and Git. I've previously done freelance work creating Minecraft plugins using the Spigot API, and now work on a range of projects as hobbies for my own enjoyment and learning.
